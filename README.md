# UK-Rates-Market-Visualisation
The aim of this code is to visualise the UK interest rate markets. After visualising UK-specific interest rate products, I go on to visualise the performance of Gilts vs Bunds and US Treasuries. Finally, I visualise the z-scores of these products. The caveat here is that Refinitiv Eikon only gives me access to the latest 3 months of asset data, meaning that the lookback period for z-score computation is not as long as I'd like it to be.
In the future, I hope to apply this visualisation code to EGBs and delve deeper into the Rates markets.

This file will only show certain snippets of the code. Full code is in the "Code" file.
